Projects 7 and 8 of the nand2tetris course: https://github.com/infl4me/nand2tetris

Project 7 objective: Build a basic VM translator, focusing on the implementation of the VM language's stack arithmetic and memory accesscommands. In Project 8, this basic translator will be extended into a full-scale VM translator.

Project 8 objective: Extend the basic VM translator built in project 7 into a full-scale VM translator. In particular, in project 7 we focused on handling the stack arithmetic and memory access commands of the VM language. We now turn to handle the VM language's branching and function calling commands.
